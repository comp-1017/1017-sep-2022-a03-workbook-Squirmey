                <p>Star Trek is an American science-fiction television series created by Gene Roddenberry that follows the adventures of the starship USS Enterprise (NCC-1701) and its crew.
                     It later acquired the retronym of Star Trek: The Original Series (TOS) to distinguish the show within the media franchise that it began (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Trek_films).</p>

                                     act and write despite no one else in her family following in any of those tracks although her father could tap dance which she didn't find out until she was about 13..
                                     He not only became mayor of their town but also a magistrate. She doesn't know where her gifts came from but she never wanted to do anything else but act.</p>
