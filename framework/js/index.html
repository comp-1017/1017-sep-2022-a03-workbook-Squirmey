<h3> Paragrap tag</h3>
<!--
    Thisis the coding block for your content in a paragraph
    The paragraph tag belongs to the "block" group of tags
    A "block" group tag places your content on a new line
    you can place all your pragraph text content on one physical line
    However, that would require a lot of scrolling right and left
    you can have word graph active in your editor and it will not affect
    how the browser displays your pragraph content. You can place your content
    on seperate lines yourself and it will not affect how the browser dispplays your paragraph content.
