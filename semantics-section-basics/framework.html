        <h2>Creating A Great Web Site Footer</h2>
One of the most important locations on your website is the footer.
 Yes, seriously. It may not be the area of the greatest design or most impressive content but it is a place where users frequently look for information.
  So it is vitally important that you donâ€™t neglect this area when planning a web design project.</p>
