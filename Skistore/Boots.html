            <h3>Alpline(downhill)</h3>
            <p>Modern alpine ski boots have rigid soles and attach to the ski at both toe and heel using a spring-loaded binding. The interface between boot and binding is
standardized by ISO 5355, which defines the size and shape of the hard plastic flanges on the toe and heel of the boot. Ski boots are sized using the Mondopoint
system. Front-entry (or "top-entry", rarely "overlap" or "Lange") boots have been the primary boot design for most of the history of downhill skiing.</p>

<h3>Snowboard</h3>
<p> Snowboard boots and bindings are normally far simpler than their downhill counterparts, rarely including release systems for instance, and need to provide
mechanical support only in the fore and aft directions. These typically consist of an external frame, generally L shaped, which the snowboarder steps into and
then fastens down using straps over the boot. The boot itself is not as responsible for transmitting forces, and can be much softer than a typical downhill boot.
When the sport was first introduced, normal winter boots were used, but today it is much more common to use semi-stiff snowboarding boots. Some specialty
disciplines use harder boots with step-in bindings more similar to downhill systems, but these are not widely used outside these fields, even though some
downhill sports teachers use these so they can switch between snowboarding or skiing classes without having to change boots.</p>


<h3>Cross-country boots, like all Nordic equipment, attach to the ski usually only at the toe of the boot and are allowed to flex at the ball of the foot similarly to a
normal shoe or boot. Cross-country boots generally use one of four attachment systems; NNN (New Nordic Norm), 75mm Nordic Norm ("three-pin" binding,
"75NN"), d-ring, or SNS (Salomon Nordic System). A four-pin binding system similar to 75NN used to be popular in the USSR. As these boots are intended for
travel over generally flat terrain, they are optimized for light weight and efficiency of motion.
